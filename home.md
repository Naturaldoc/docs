## The Basics

You know what they say: "read the instructions". Laravel's documentation is top-notch. Seriously. It's clear and concise, plus chock full of helpful examples. Tired of having to read another framework's computer generated API just to figure out how to use it? Laravel's documentation will be a breath of fresh air.

Even though you may jump into any section and start learning, if you are new to Laravel, consider skimming through the documentation in order, as it will be a great tutorial and get you up to speed with every aspect of Laravel.
