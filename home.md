## The Basics

Welcome to the Laravel documentation. These documents were designed to function both as a getting-started guide and as a feature reference. Even though you may jump into any section and start learning, we recommend reading the documentation in order as it allows us to progressively establish concepts that will be used in later documents.

## Who Will Enjoy Laravel?

Laravel is a powerful framework that emphasizes flexibility and expressiveness. Users new to Laravel will enjoy the same ease of development that is found in the most popular and lightweight PHP frameworks. More experienced users will appreciate the opportunity to modularize their code in ways that are not possible with other frameworks. Laravel's flexibility will allow your organization to update and mold the application over time as is needed and its expressiveness will allow you and your team to develop code that is both concise and easily read.

## Laravel's Community

Laravel is lucky to be supported by rapidly growing, friendly and enthusiastic community. The [Laravel Forums](http://forums.laravel.com) are a great place to find help, make a suggestion, or just see what other people are saying.

Many of us hang out every day in the #laravel IRC channel on FreeNode. [Here's a forum post explaining how you can join us.](http://forums.laravel.com/viewtopic.php?id=671) Hanging out in the IRC channel is a really great way to learn more about web-development using Laravel. You're welcome to ask questions, answer other people's questions, or just hang out and learn from other people's questions being answered. We love Laravel and would love to talk to you about it, so don't be a stranger!

## Laravel's Requirements

Laravel takes advantage of the powerful features that have become available in PHP 5.3. Consequently, PHP 5.3 is a requirement.

Laravel uses the FileInfo PHP module to analyze mime types of open files. This is included by default with PHP 5.3. However, Windows users may need to add a line to their php.ini file before the module is enabled. Check out the [installation / configuration details on PHP.net](http://php.net/manual/en/fileinfo.installation.php).
