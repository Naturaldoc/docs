## The Basics

You know what they say: "read the instructions". Laravel's documentation is top-notch. Seriously. It's clear and concise, plus chock full of helpful examples. Tired of having to read another framework's computer generated API just to figure out how to use it? Laravel's documentation will be a breath of fresh air.

Even though you may jump into any section and start learning, if you are new to Laravel, consider skimming through the documentation in order, as it will be a great tutorial and get you up to speed with every aspect of Laravel.

## Laravel's Requirements

Laravel takes advantage of the powerful features that have become available in PHP 5.3.  Consequently, PHP 5.3 is a requirement.

Laravel uses the FileInfo PHP module to analyze mime types of open files.  This is included by default with PHP 5.3.  However, Windows users may need to add a line to their php.ini file before the module is enabled.  Check out the [installation / configuration details on PHP.net](http://php.net/manual/en/fileinfo.installation.php).
