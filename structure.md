# Laravel's Application Structure

Laravel's directory structure is designed to be familiar to users of other popular PHP frameworks. Web applications of any shape or size can easily be created using this structure similarly to the way that they would be created in other frameworks.

However due to Laravel's unique architecture, it is possible for developers to create their own infrastructure that is specifically designed for their application. This may be most beneficial to large projects such as content-management-systems. This kind of architectural flexibility is unique to Laravel.

Throughout the documentation we'll specify the default locations for declarations where appropriate.
